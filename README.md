# MERN-family-app
This is my first MongoDb, Express, React, Node Project.
You can visit it at https://mern-family-app.vercel.app/

Welcome to my personal MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) application repository. This project showcases my skills in full-stack web development and serves as a demonstration of my learning journey.

## Backend

For the backend of this application, I utilized Express, a fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js. Express provided a solid foundation for building RESTful APIs and handling server-side logic. Following the standard MERN stack architecture, I integrated MongoDB as the database and leveraged Mongoose as the ODM (Object Data Modeling) library.

To set up the backend, please follow these steps:

1. Start by installing the required dependencies using `npm install`.
2. Configure the MongoDB connection by replacing the `uri` variable in the `server.js` file with your own MongoDB connection string.
3. Launch the backend server by executing `npm start`.

Here are the key features and components of the backend:

- **Database**: MongoDB serves as the database for this application. Before running the backend, ensure that you have MongoDB installed and running on your system.
- **Routes**: I have implemented several API endpoints to manage family member data. The base route is `/api/v1/family`, and the available routes include `/members`. These routes support standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, DELETE, and PATCH to perform CRUD operations.
- **Middleware**: To handle requests effectively, I utilized the `express.json()` middleware for parsing incoming JSON payloads and the `cors` middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).

For a detailed overview of the backend implementation, please refer to the `server.js` file.

## Frontend

The frontend of this application is developed using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React enables efficient rendering and component-based development, resulting in a responsive and interactive user experience. Additionally, I incorporated the Material UI library for designing aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly components.

To set up and run the frontend, please follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory using the command `cd frontend`.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Launch the development server by executing `npm start`.

Here are the key features and components of the frontend:

- **Routes**: I have created route pages for the home and adding a member functionalities. I utilized React Router to manage navigation between these pages effectively.
- **API Integration**: To interact with the backend API, I employed Axios, a widely used HTTP client. It simplifies the process of fetching data from the backend and performing CRUD operations.
- **Material UI**: I took advantage of the Material UI library to implement pre-designed and customizable components, enhancing the overall visual appeal and professionalism of the user interface.

For a detailed overview of the frontend implementation, please refer to the `client` directory.

## Getting Started

To get started with my MERN application, please follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the command `git clone https://github.com/Ayban-17/MERN-family-app.git`
2. Configure the backend as described above, ensuring that the MongoDB connection is properly set up.
3. Set up and launch the frontend as described above.
4. Access the application by opening your web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:3000`.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your specific requirements. Happy coding!

## Note on Service Reliability

Please note that the backend of this project is hosted on the Render.com platform, which provides a reliable hosting infrastructure for web applications. However, as with any service, occasional disruptions or performance issues may occur.

Render.com strives to maintain a high level of uptime and availability, but it's important to acknowledge that unforeseen circumstances or maintenance activities may impact the availability of the API endpoints. 

In the event of any temporary disruptions, the API responses may experience delays or intermittent errors. If you encounter any issues while using the application, I kindly request your patience and understanding.

I actively monitor the service and work diligently to address any potential issues promptly. Should you encounter persistent problems, please don't hesitate to reach out to me, and I will do my best to resolve the situation as quickly as possible.

Thank you for your understanding and support.
